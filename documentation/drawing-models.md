// Under construction //

The drawing model can be used to generate simple drawings that can be included in plots and reports.

- a simple model for generating drawings (lines, ellipses, rectangles, text etc)
- reuses render contexts and exporters
- provide custom controls (will try to share code with the plot controls)
- drawings can be included in the [report models](./report-models)
