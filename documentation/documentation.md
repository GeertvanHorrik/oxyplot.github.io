### API documentation

The API documentation is the reference to all namespaces and types of the library. 
The documentation is provided [online](http://resources.oxyplot.org/documentation/API/) and as a [compiled help file](http://resources.oxyplot.org/documentation/oxyplot.chm) (chm).

The API documentation is generated from XML comments in the code. All methods and properties should be documented in compliance with the StyleCop rules. 

Namespaces are documented in `NamespaceDoc.cs` files.

The library as a whole is documented in the `LibraryDoc.cs` file. The content of this file is shown on the index page of the API documentation.

Currently, include files are not used in the XML comments, but this should be considered if documentation gets longer...

The API Documentation is generated by the `XmlDocT`. This tool converts the .dll and .xml files to .html and also create a help contents file (.hhc) for the help compiler.  XmlDocT is a part of the [http://lynx.codeplex.com|Lynx toolkit] and can be found in the `Tools\Lynx` folder

The Microsoft Help Compiler is used to build the .chm file.

The script can be found at `Build\GenerateAPIDocumentation.cmd`


### User's guide

The user's guide contains "hand-written" information about how to use the library. The user's guide is provided online (html) and as a compiled help file (chm). There will also be a printable version (pdf).
