TODO - How to create a custom series.

You can create your own custom series by implementing the `ISeries` interface, or by deriving from one of the existing `Series` classes.
To make the series available for the tracker, you should also implement the `ITrackableSeries` interface.

### Base classes

- `ItemsSeries` - base class for series that are defined by items.
- `XYAxisSeries` - base class for series that use X and Y axes.
- `DataPointSeries` - base class for series that contain a collection of `DataPoint`.
